### Abstract:

Object detection in autonomous cars is commonly
based on camera images and Lidar inputs, which are often used
to train prediction models such as deep artificial neural networks
for decision making for object recognition, adjusting speed, etc.
A mistake in such decision making can be damaging; thus, it
is vital to measure the reliability of decisions made by such
prediction models via uncertainty measurement. Uncertainty,
in deep learning models, is often measured for classification
problems. However, deep learning models in autonomous driving
are often multi-output regression models. Hence, we propose a
novel method called PURE (Prediction sURface uncErtainty) for
measuring prediction uncertainty of such regression models. We
formulate the object recognition problem as a regression model
with more than one outputs for finding object locations in a
2-dimensional camera view. For evaluation, we modified three
widely-applied object recognition models (i.e., YoLo, SSD300
and SSD512) and used the KITTI, Stanford Cars, Berkeley
DeepDrive, and NEXET datasets. Results showed the statistically significant negative correlation between prediction surface
uncertainty and prediction accuracy suggesting that uncertainty
significantly impacts the decisions made by autonomous driving.

### Abstract:

The safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) has become one of the hottest topics in the feld of autonomous driving.
However, no testing and evaluating system for SOTIF performance has been proposed yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a
framework based on the advanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm and the mean Average Precision (mAP) method
to evaluate the object detection performance of the camera under SOTIF-related scenarios. First, a dataset is established,
which contains road images with extreme weather and adverse lighting conditions. Second, the Monte Carlo dropout (MCD)
method is used to analyze the uncertainty of the algorithm and draw the uncertainty region of the predicted bounding box.
Then, the confdence of the algorithm is calibrated based on uncertainty results so that the average confdence after calibration can better refect the real accuracy. The uncertainty results and the calibrated confdence are proposed to be used for
online risk identifcation. Finally, the confusion matrix is extended according to the several possible mistakes that the object
detection algorithm may make, and then the mAP is calculated as an index for ofine evaluation and comparison. This paper
ofers suggestions to apply the MCD method to complex object detection algorithms and to fnd the relationship between
the uncertainty and the confdence of the algorithm. The experimental results verifed by specifc SOTIF scenarios proof the
feasibility and efectiveness of the proposed uncertainty acquisition approach for object detection algorithm, which provides
potential practical implementation chance to address perceptual related SOTIF risk for autonomous vehicles.

### Abstract:

One of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving, and in computer vision in general, is the task of object detection. Recently, the advances
of deep learning in the domain of computer vision have led the research community to apply ideas from deep learning to the problem of object detection.
Such frameworks have shown promising results by outperforming all of the
traditional approaches based on hand-crafted features. However, deep neural
networks fail to provide reliability measurement for their predictions, which
is a crucial requirement for critical systems. Moreover, it has been shown that
deep neural networks tend to give more overconfident predictions compared
to their shallow counterpart.
Our objective with the current degree project is to review popular deep
neural object detection frameworks and to investigate methods for uncertainty
estimation in deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we would like
to find out if applying a method of uncertainty estimation could improve the
performance of a deep neural object detector in terms of standard object detection metrics such as average precision and log average miss rate. Moreover,
we aim at discovering if an approach for measuring reliability improves the
calibration quality of an object detector. Finally, we focus on investigating if
uncertainty estimates could be utilised for detecting misclassified examples or
highly occluded/truncated objects within an image.
In order to answer these questions, we construct a variety of experiments
that investigate different setups and conditions. Overall, we found that uncertainty estimation is a promising approach for alleviating overconfidence in
deep neural networks as well as for providing a reliability measurement for all
predictions.
