### Abstract:

Object detection in autonomous cars is commonly
based on camera images and Lidar inputs, which are often used
to train prediction models such as deep artificial neural networks
for decision making for object recognition, adjusting speed, etc.
A mistake in such decision making can be damaging; thus, it
is vital to measure the reliability of decisions made by such
prediction models via uncertainty measurement. Uncertainty,
in deep learning models, is often measured for classification
problems. However, deep learning models in autonomous driving
are often multi-output regression models. Hence, we propose a
novel method called PURE (Prediction sURface uncErtainty) for
measuring prediction uncertainty of such regression models. We
formulate the object recognition problem as a regression model
with more than one outputs for finding object locations in a
2-dimensional camera view. For evaluation, we modified three
widely-applied object recognition models (i.e., YoLo, SSD300
and SSD512) and used the KITTI, Stanford Cars, Berkeley
DeepDrive, and NEXET datasets. Results showed the statistically significant negative correlation between prediction surface
uncertainty and prediction accuracy suggesting that uncertainty
significantly impacts the decisions made by autonomous driving.
